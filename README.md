# 🎬 Cinemanch – Smart Movie Ticket Booking App

**Cinemanch** is a modern, full-stack web application for seamless movie ticket booking. It replicates the core functionality of platforms like BookMyShow, combining real-time interactivity, secure payment handling, and personalized user engagement — all powered by cutting-edge technologies.

This project highlights my skills in building **end-to-end scalable web applications** using **React**, **Node.js**, **Clerk**, **Stripe**, **Brevo**, and **Inngest**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used


1)Frontend:
React.js – Dynamic UI rendering and state management

React Router – Seamless client-side navigation

Context API – Global state management for user/session data

Tailwind CSS – Responsive and consistent UI design

2)Authentication:
Clerk – Complete user authentication and session management (Sign up, Login, OTP, Social logins)

3)Backend:
Node.js + Express.js – RESTful API development and routing

MongoDB + Mongoose – NoSQL database and schema modeling for shows, users, and bookings

4)Payments:
Stripe – Secure and reliable payment integration for ticket purchases

5)Email & Notification:
Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) – Email delivery for booking confirmations, reminders, and announcements

6)Background Tasks & Scheduling:
Inngest – Serverless workflow orchestration for sending scheduled emails (8-hour reminders, show updates)

7)DevOps & Deployment:
Vercel – Hosting backend and frontend services

8)GitHub – Version control and collaboration



## 📩 Smart Email Automations

- ✉️ **Booking Confirmation** — Email sent right after successful payment  
- ⏰ **Reminder Email** — Sent 8 hours before the showtime  
- 🆕 **New Show Notification** — Auto-broadcasted to all users upon show creation  

These flows are automated using **Brevo** and **Inngest**, ensuring high engagement without manual overhead.

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

- Real-world scale features like dynamic seat booking and payment workflows
- Fully secure auth and data handling
- Third-party integrations to simulate production environments
- Hands-on experience with asynchronous workflows and transactional events

## 👨‍💻 My Role & Ownership

I independently built **Cinemanch** from scratch — from designing the UI to integrating third-party services. The application showcases my ability to think like a **full-stack developer** and implement features that align with **real user needs** and **business logic**.

## 📎 Final Thoughts

Cinemanch isn't just a project — it's a demonstration of how I approach real-world problem solving using the modern web stack. It combines user experience, backend scalability, and operational efficiency, making it ideal to showcase in professional settings.
